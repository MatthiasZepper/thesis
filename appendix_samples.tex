	\caption{Donor and recipient mice IDs and transplant hierarchy for the WGBS and CAGE-seq samples. The original donors of the untransduced bone marrow for both genotypes could no longer be determined. The mouse IDs of the primary recipients, which were transplanted by Lena Vockentanz are listed in the colored boxes. The secondary transplants of frozen ex-vivo leukemic bone marrow from the primary recipients were performed by Irina Savelyeva, who also sorted the ex-vivo bone marrow after the animals succumbed to their disease.}
